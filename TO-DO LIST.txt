TO-DO LIST:
- (PC) Visualize the selected points from RL and AL
- (PC/Cluster) Test multiprocessing
- (Done) Train final model
--> Finalize base, step 18 (100), step 43 (200) : res thursday
- (PC) Compare results
- (PC ?) Why so much training history ? 
- (PC) From & to file
- (PC) Add summary & history to MM
- (Cluster) MM improvement loop

PRESENTATION:
- Loss is model dependant, not sample dependant
- Active learning vs Random learning
- Results

CONCLUSIONS : 
- Final AL vs RL : not much difference -> Try at step 50 ? Earlier ? Compare step 50 to step 118 ?
- Generate different initial grids w/ different methods, finalize, compare (doable today for tomorrow)

THURSDAY : 
- Copy all the _final models
- Analyze (R2 ; find a way to compare)
- Copy all method models
- Analyze (R2 ; mustach box)
