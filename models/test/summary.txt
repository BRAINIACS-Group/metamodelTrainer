Call obj.model.summary() for more details on architecture (provided by keras)

Optimizer : Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
Loss measure : mae

Data is scaled before and after prediction using StandardScalers.
Data is interpolated using 1000 timesteps between 0 and None seconds.

Trained for 5 epochs on 20 samples.
